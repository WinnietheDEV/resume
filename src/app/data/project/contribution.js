            purchase orders (PO), which includes functionalities such as
            forwarding, reversing, skipping, and approving PRs/POs. Given that
            PRs/POs contain multiple items, itâ€™s crucial to maintain the
            relationship between PRs/POs and their items. Additionally, the
            process involves integrating information from other tables, such as
            departments and users, to ensure comprehensive and accurate
            management.`,

export const clinicContribution = [
  {
    name: "Fixing bugs",
    detail: `I have been tasked with reviewing and understanding code written by other developers, identifying and diagnosing bugs, and implementing fixes. One notable challenge was pinpointing the root cause of issues in the existing codebase. For example, I addressed a problem where adding a new appointment would alter existing appointment information. This issue was traced back to the code not resetting every field in the form and erroneously using the same patient ID for multiple appointments. My role involved analyzing these problems, understanding their underlying causes, and making the necessary code improvements.`,
  },
  {
    name: "Improving code",
    detail: `I created a new API to consolidate a series of related tasks that were previously handled by separate APIs. Specifically, in the payment process workflow, it was essential to update the OPD status to inactive (indicating that the treatment is complete), update the payment, and chain it with the OPD ID while performing additional tasks. The original issue arose because these steps were fragmented across different APIs. This fragmentation led to problems, such as when a user double-clicked a button, causing the API call to be sent multiple times. If the first API call hadn't completed before the second call was made, the OPD ID would already be used from the first call, causing errors in chaining with the payment. My solution involved integrating these steps into a single API to ensure that the workflow is executed consistently and correctly, even in the case of multiple API calls.`,
